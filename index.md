With [Software Carpentry lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and [Data Carpentry lessons](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/) you learn the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research in your field and learn to write simple 
programs.

This one-day workshop will introduce you to Python for analyzing and visualizing spatial-temporal data. We will be using datasets from the environmental sciences that are freely available. 


We will learn:

- how to identify some of the most common data formats (raster formats) in environmental Sciences i.e.
[netCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf_introduction.html) and [HDF](https://support.hdfgroup.org/) ([HDF-EOS](http://hdfeos.org/) and [HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)),
[GeoTIFF](https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/).
- How to view the content of these binary files 
- How to identify the provenance and explore metadata
- How to organise your data and develop a simple data management plan to ease your work
- How to access and process data in commonly used raster formats such as GeoTIFF, HDF-EOS, HDF5 and netCDF. 
- How to combine them with vector datasets such as ESRI Shapefile and GeoJSON.


The meaning of these terms will become clear as we work through the python notebooks.


> ## Prerequisites
>
> 1.  Learners need to understand what files and directories are and
>     what a working directory is. These concepts are covered in the 
>     [Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) lesson.
> 2.  Learners need to have some prior knowledge of Python. For instance,
>     what is covered in the Software Carpentry lesson 
>     [Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) 
>     is more than sufficient.
>
> 2. Learners must install Python and a few additional python libraries before the class starts.
>    See [the setup instructions]({{ page.root }}/setup/)
>
> 3. Learners must get the metos data before class starts:
>    please download and unzip the file 
>    [metos-python-data.tar](https://zenodo.org/record/995709/files/metos-python-data.tar).
>
>    Please see [the setup instructions]({{ page.root }}/setup/)
>    for details.
